## Task Background :
In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:
- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management.
